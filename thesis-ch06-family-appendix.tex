      Figure~\ref{fig:family:example} in Chapter~\ref{chap:family}.
      The underlying family consists of five sets:
      $A$, $B$, $C$, $S_{12}$, and $S_{23}$.
      Transitions between states are shown for indicators
      $\mathbf{1}_A$,
      $\mathbf{1}_B$,
      and $\mathbf{1}_C$,
      with solid lines
      showing transitions in which the indicator returns True,
      and dashed lines
      showing transitions in which the indicator returns False.
      Also shown is the distance function and optimal policy
      for a query subset $S_u = S_{23}$,
      with green beliefs as goal states.
      Bolded edges
      represent transitions on an optimal policy.
