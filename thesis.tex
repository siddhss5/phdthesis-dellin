\vspace{0.2in}

\cdnote{I need to rewrite this -- while multi-step tasks
(e.g. arising from manipulation problems) are a well-suited application,
I think the thesis contributions are more broadly applicable.}

In order to assist humans
with dangerous or menial tasks,
autonomous robots will need to
act under significant time and energy constraints.
At task time,
the amount of effort a robot spends planning directly
detracts from its total performance.
Tasks such as manipulation, however, present challenges
to efficient motion planning.
They are often tightly coupled --
while moving an object can be decomposed into
steps (reach, grasp, transfer, release),
each step requires choices (e.g. which grasp),
and committing to a bad choice
can render subsequent steps difficult;
this encourages longer planning horizons.
However,
an articulated robot
situated within a geometrically complex and dynamic environment
induces a high-dimensional configuration space
in which it is expensive to test for valid paths.
And since multi-step plans
require paths in changing valid subsets of configuration space,
it is difficult to reuse computation across steps
or maintain caches between tasks.

We focus on a motion planning approach for coupled multi-step
manipulation problems that is efficient over the entire task
(including both planning and execution).
We contend that the problem's cost structure
favors explicit handling of
both graph representation and task effort optimization,
and propose a graph search algorithm which captures these insights
given a model of planning effort.
We offer methods for roadmap construction
which seek to balance completeness with efficiency at task time.
We then unify previous work examining configuration space structure of
related problems (e.g. multi-step manipulation)
into a general set-theoretic formulation
which suggests a planning effort model
to be exploited by our roadmap search algorithm,
yielding a motion planner which
efficiently reuses computation between queries.
We also present a task planner
that maps a task decomposition into queries to our motion planner.
Our insights yield complementary components
which, taken together,
constitute an efficient approach to planning manipulation tasks.

This dissertation places an emphasis on experimental evaluation
of the individual constituent algorithms
and the approach as a whole.
We will compare against
state-of-the-art task and motion planners
on multiple robotic platforms,
in applications from home table clearing
to remote disaster response.
We also provide open-source implementations of our algorithms.
