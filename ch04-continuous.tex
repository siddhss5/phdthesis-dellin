\chapter{Roadmaps in Continuous Spaces}
\label{chap:graphs-in-continuous}

Sweet, sweet chapter about how to best embed explicit graphs
in continuous configuration spaces.

\section{Types of Graphs}

\begin{itemize}
\item Probabalistic vs lattice-based graphs.
\item Probabalistic (pseudo-random) for efficient caching.
\end{itemize}

\section{Optimization in Expectation}

Extend the Greedy PRM algorith to do things in expectation.

Relate to Evan's work.

Motivate the incremental densification idea,
with a graduated cost model
to approximate a probabalistic model
of the $\mathcal{C}$-space.

\section{Batching}

Choosing Batch Size $N$.

What graph are we searching over?
If it's too sparse, we'll stop after knowing that no solution exists.
If it's too dense, we'll spend too much time filling in parts of
space.
There's actually some spatial relationship in
$\mathcal{C}_{\mbox{\scriptsize free}}$ what we're not
modeling.
We get around this with artificial sparseness.
There's definitely a paper's worth of work here too (Shushman's stuff).
The easy version is with sequential batches of size $N$.
Talk about how what we really want to do
is evaluate the estimate of cost remaining
\emph{in expectation}.

Talk about how this is complementary to BIT* which acheive speedups
by batching, not by inflating.

Relate to Markov Random Fields and two-class image segmentation
which capture spatial correlation.

\section{Whole-Path Bisection Testing}

Also talk here about the fancy Lazy PRM path bisection
evaluation function.

\section{The $\mbox{E}^8$ PRM}

This is the planner in continuous spaces,
requires a planning cost model for each edge.

\section{Relaxing the Additive Cost Model Requirement}

Could we do this?
We lose the nice efficient LPA*-enabling structure in
$\mbox{E}^8$ this way,
but it lets us incorporate a more accurate cost model in some domains,
especially for execution costs for fast motions (e.g. total time).

\section{Future Work}

How to handle the narrow passage problem?
Lots of literature on that, new sampling strategies, etc.
(Toggle PRM, for instance.)
