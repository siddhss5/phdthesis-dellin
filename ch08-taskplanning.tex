\section{The \textsc{Proteus} Task Planner}

Uses CMR.
Runs separate Multi-Set PRMs.

Lots of literature in subgoal planning to connect to here.

Proteus Reasons Over Task Effort Using Sampling.

To be clear, no symbolic planning here --
complementary!

\section{Interleaved Planning and Execution}
\label{sec:interleaved}

We talk about how the approach in this thesis is
amenable to interleaved planning and execution.
Proteus can just keep updating $q_{\mbox{\scriptsize init}}$.

``The \textsc{Proteus} task planning server
will handle moving starts.''

\section{Future Work}

\subsection{Learning Good Intermediate Roots}
\label{subsec:learning-good-intermediate-roots}

This would be a really cool research problem;
very complementary!
