   abstract = {
      Robots that perform complex manipulation tasks must be able to generate
      strategies that make and break contact with the object.
      This requires reasoning in a motion space with a particular multi-modal
      structure, in which the state contains both a discrete mode
      (the contact state) and a continuous configuration
      (the robot and object poses).
      In this paper we address multi-modal motion planning in the common
      setting where the state is high-dimensional, and there are a
      continuous infinity of modes.
      We present a highly general algorithm, Random-MMP, that repeatedly
      attempts mode switches sampled at random.
      A major theoretical result is that Random-MMP is formally reliable and
      scalable, and its running time depends on certain properties of the
      multi-modal structure of the problem that are not explicitly dependent
      on dimensionality.
      We apply the planner to a manipulation task on the Honda humanoid
      robot, where the robot is asked to push an object to a desired location
      on a cluttered table, and the robot is restricted to switch between
      walking, reaching, and pushing modes.
      Experiments in simulation and on the real robot demonstrate that
      Random-MMP solves problem instances that require several carefully
      chosen pushes in minutes on a PC.
